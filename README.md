## :zap: Quick Information
My journey in the field of development and technology began early. At the age of 11, I was already taking my first steps in programming. By 15, I was taking technical courses, and at 18, I started doing freelance work and building systems for fun. At 26, I moved away from programming and ventured into user support and maintenance roles. At 30, I returned to studying and re-entered the development field. The pursuit of constant learning is a core value for me as a way to enhance my professional career.

As a Software Engineer, I strive to enhance my technical competencies across various key areas. My skills encompass Software Development (Python, Java, and others), Software Engineering, Software Architecture, testing, version control using git, NLP, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, SPARQL, RDF, Knowledge Graphs, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), creation/orchestration of containers using Docker and Kubernetes, CI/CD, Elasticsearch, BigData, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and extensive teamwork.

I have also worked as a Freelance Website Developer on various projects, working with a range of technologies including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, Angular, React.js, Laravel, WordPress.

I profoundly believe that technology has the power to positively impact the world. I am committed to creating innovative and scalable solutions that meet the highest quality standards. My goal is to contribute to projects that make a tangible impact, delivering quality code while maintaining consistent communication and collaboration with the team.

I am proudly a founding volunteer of Grupy Sul Fluminense, a community dedicated to strengthening and spreading Python knowledge in the Sul Fluminense region.
